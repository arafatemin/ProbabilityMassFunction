About Us
About Darul Iman Academy and Yusuf Hashacip Foundation: Our school was established in 2014 in Zeytinburnu, Istanbul, with the contribution of willing and determined teachers in the field of science and education, and Yusuf Has Hacib Foundation was established in 2017. Since the day it was founded, our school has been providing systematic education in Islamic sciences and some branches of science such as English, mathematics and Turkish. This year, with the help of God, as a result of the prayers of our strong-willed teachers and our nation, we have completed our 9th year. In our 10th year, we are ready to start our work for the future of Islam and our nation. The number of active academic teachers in our school is over 40, and we are among the schools that provide the most comprehensive and systematic education services among the schools in Turkey. More than 1000 students receive Islamic sciences and basic sciences education in our school every year. Since 2017, our school has been officially supporting the "İman Diyar Kuran Kursi" service by the Ministry of National Education and the Istanbul Küçük Çekmece Mufti's Office services by the Turkish Government, and it continues at full speed.
